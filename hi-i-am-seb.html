        <h2>My favourite type of potato</h2>
        
        <p>
            There are multiple types of potatoes on the streets. However, I think it is very important that the potatoes you buy are legit and safe to consume. Sometimes you might get very dodgy potato dealers and they sell you potatoes that are bad and can cause another Irish famine which leads to thousands of deaths.

        <h2>My favourite type of bread</h2>
    
        <p>
           I often eat dark or wholemeal bread because that bread is good for ye. I mean if you eat enough of it, then you will be happy. Here's a riddle: If white milk comes from white cows, then what colour milk comes from brown cows? Americans often get this wrong, but then they also believe in God and voted Trump, so no surprise there.
