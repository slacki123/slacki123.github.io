        <h2>Microwave Cooking</h2>
        
        <p> I like garlic bread, but it is also important to cook other stuff. I cook in my flat sometimes by using a microwave. Cooking in a normal way really sucks because it takes time. Little that you know, if you just whack your food into a microwave for like 10 minutes, your food will be cooked and piping hot. The picture below depicts me the in the morning after a night out. </p>
